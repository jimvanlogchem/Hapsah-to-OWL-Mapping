# Hapsah-to-OWL-Mapping

Hapsah-to-OWL-Converter.py is the algorithm that converts a Hapsah ontology into an OWL ontology.

Hapsah-ontology.owl is the supportive Hapsah ontology in OWL that is used to be able to separateClasses representing Entity Types, Descriptor Types and Roles from each other.


grocery-store-example-converted.owl is the OWL ontology that was created from executing the Hapsah-to-OWL-Converter.py on the grocery store example Hapsah ontology.

football-example-converted.owl is the OWL ontology created from executing the Hapsah-to-OWL-Converter.py on football example Hapsah ontology created by a third party.


grocery-store-example-converted.owl and football-example-converted.owl are the OWL ontologies created during the validation of the mapping.
